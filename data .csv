"HP 17 Laptop, 17.3” HD+ Display, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1125G4 Processor, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Wi-Fi, HDMI, Webcam, Windows 11 Home, Silver","The laptop's screen is huge and great picture quality. Speakers are great even at max volume. Setup was easy including adding and syncing devices. The camera is truly 720p (not the best) but works. The battery life doesn't seem to be as long as I'd expect. It operates fast even with multiple applications running. Overall, great purchase.",5

It wasn't easy to switch the operating system from Safe mode to Windows Home 11 but I finally succeeded and there weren't any charges from doing that. I do agree with the person who complained about the keyboard characters being hard to see, but that is only if there is a glare on it from the lamp. I can see them fine in normal light. It is plenty fast and has automatic functions that are user friendly. My laptop was stolen at the UPS processing center by some seasonal worker (apparently this is a common problem) before it got to me and an empty open box with another box of bolts for someone else was what was delivered. I took pictures of it and reported it to UPS and have heard nothing from them in follow-up. Amazon was great! They processed the replacement request and work with the seller without any hassle for me, and replaced the stolen laptop free of charge and promptly! Thank goodness! I really like my new laptop!",5

With a fresh OS theres no reason why i should have keyboard lag and applications taking a bit to load, id rather save 100-200 more and get yourself something with better CPU, most laptops you will find with a price range of 100-200 more will probably not give you 16gb of ram or 1tb ssd, but the sacrifice will be worth the better cpu, plus you can always add more ram to the laptop later.",5

I detest S mode so paid a little more for having regular Win11. But the computer arrived with Win11 in S mode, and trying to get that switched off took some significant hoop jumping. I finally managed to do so but the listing needs to be changed to reflect that the OS is not regular Win11 but is operating in S mode out of the box.",3

Each day he sees ways it will make little irritating things better, and its making those little irritating things better for me because I don't have to listen to them!

The shipping was very fast, it came in 2 or 3 days and I used the free shipping. The setting up process was very simple, it didn’t come charge so you will need to charge it. The keyboard is sleek and like how there’s a number pad. It does get in the way of my typing but that’s okay. It does have the type c adapter thing which is basically the same as the newer iPhone needing an adapter to use wired headphones. It does have 1tb of storage which I didn’t believe that could be real for this price same as 16gbs of ram. It has a Bluetooth adapter as advertised and it’s fairly simple to connect to any headphones or earbuds. It does run very fast because of the 16GBs. If you were to get the 8gb or anything lower it will run on the slower end. It isn’t touch screen which I personally like because I don’t have to worry about cleaning my screen often. The camera is great for the price. I wouldn’t use my laptops speakers because it won’t sound as good as using earbuds or headphones. I haven’t tested the mic yet. The battery life I haven’t tested however when I start college I will make sure I update how far it runs. I would definitely recommend anyone who is going into college to buy this laptop. The storage and ram at this price is amazing.",5

Nothing really special about it but I wanted something that wasn’t going to be $1,000. The Wi-Fi seems to be extremely slow with this laptop so I usually plug in the Ethernet cable when using the internet, otherwise speeds are really slow. The main reason I got this laptop was for writing books. With that being said, if you use it for anything like this, save your work frequently. On a weekly basis, and sometimes multiple times in a day or week, the laptop crashes. It goes to this blue screen with an error message and then it reboots. It’s kind of annoying. Whether this is a fault in the laptop or windows 11, I’m not sure. But other than that, it’s ok. Not great. Not spectacular. It’s a very basic laptop. Also, they have this laptop described as being a touchscreen, which it is not. I don’t really care about that because the last thing I want is fingerprints all over my screen, however, that is clearly false advertising. So if you are looking for a laptop with a touch screen, this is not the one.",2

I think its a software issue, but I'm returning.Nice smaller laptop, I think it will work for school nicely.  My only complaint was the shipping box.  Either the tape wasn't put on well down the center or someone tried to open it.Many of my packages have been arriving with the tape moved or open on the ends.  I suppose it could be a machine issue.This was untapped in the center top, someone could have tried peeking to see, and they would have easily.Laptop was in fine shape and I received safely.  Will be a lot easier than carrying my big heave 17inch to class.  I don't notice much difference in the slightly smaller 14.6 inch screen.  It is not touch screen, didn't think it was.

After that you need to pay a subscription. I suggest you download Libre Office. Works the same way and I found no issues with Libre (so far). The battery life last for hours and recharge quickly. It is NOT touchscreen, just add a mouse or better yet, a wireless mouse. Works just fine! The laptop weighs 3.64 lbs. so light to take just about anywhere, like an airplane and I have.

Because I presume you gave at least one of them a nickel.  It's the same 14"" lap that I've been buying for years, whoa!  Except they took away the backlit keyboard!  And it still has only two USB ports on one side, placed too close together to put most Flash drives in at the same time.  If you stick your ear on the left side of the board, I swear you can hear crickets - one lonely Micro SD slot.  And thank goodness for that because buying a 512 card is the only way you're ever going to get enough hard memory to run the thing, seriously 22Gs available.  Look, I'm all for the hiring of lower order primates, but make sure they can do the job.As for the stupidity of Windows 11 compared with the functionality of 10, suffice it to say ""NO 'MOVE to' Tab""?  What?  Do you people even use your own product?  Cuz' it seems like you're using too much of Heisenberg's.  I'll let you people discover for yourselves all the unnecessarily added and misdirected changes these vapid cold-earth wanderers found of value in putting out this atrocity of an OS.  Let me just leave you all with a little anecdote which I believe man of you can relate to regarding the miracle of S-mode, which I'm certain many of you have determined what expletive that letter stands for.I wanted to put on OpenOffice as my word processor, a program I have used and trusted for many years.  It's free and easy to use without any advertisements or gimmicks.  Still not on the list.  Edge told me no.  So being lazy, I went online just to check the path to do so.  I'd tell you all the wrong information MS lists as how to do it at their very unhelpful website and all the shady, blathering tech sites I had to visit, but I honestly can't remember them all.  Something to do with apps and activation, nothing close to MS's instructions, wound up getting directed to the store, had to ""GET"" out of S mode.  Did it, got my half the memory, all the good bells and whistles without all the Word junk, free word-processing program and went on my way.Next task I spotted was a problem with a restart necessary to fix a security problem.  Ok, no prob there.  Went to check security again, got a notification that my app security had a problem.  Seems someone had turned off the S mode which as we are all told banishes you outside the gates of MSlandia into a world of certain darkness, evil clowns, and bats.  Complete hysteria (cats and dogs living together, that sort of thing.  If Bill Gates ever gets a tattoo, it'll say S-Mode or Die.Well then what was this simple two-step solution in my security notification area?  You got it.  It wanted me to turn S-mode back on and I did.  Because.... whatever.  Windows could much easier just tell you the app you're about to download isn't on the list and please check the MS store first, if not giving you a list of suggested replacements.  Nope, rigamarole.I paid $400 plus tax which is about twice what I figured I should pay for a keyboard that ISN'T EVEN BACKLIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2

It’s way too slow for me to use for work. I wound up giving it to a family member who didn’t need to do more than the most basic stuff. (Really regret throwing out the box before I tested it out!) It’s a shame because it’s a pretty little laptop that types smoothly. But if you need to do anything besides basic word processing, it’s probably not a good fit.",3

"Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-347N Slim Laptop - 15.6"" Full HD IPS Display - 11th Gen Intel i3-1115G4 Dual Core Processor - 8GB DDR4 - 128GB NVMe SSD - WiFi 6 - Amazon Alexa - Windows 11 Home in S Mode","This is an economy laptop that is marginally better than the average Chromebook.  Do not expect it to run the latest games or any graphically intensive applications.  With that stated, I am utilizing these at a non profit charity that which mostly utilizes cloud based applications.  These computers work very well at this task while providing the future proofing of being Windows 11 compliant.We are replacing ACER Aspire E15 series laptops with this model.  The E15s were mostly generation 7 & 8 I3 and i5 models with SATA III SSDs and 8GB of RAM.  The NVMe drives are much faster than the older SATA III drives.  I miss the extra RAM, but not enough to crack open these cases for upgrades.  My volunteers appreciate the lighter weight and slimmer size.  I don't remember the last time we actually utilized an optical drive or card reader which were lost with the slimmer case.These have smaller batteries than our older models.  That coupled with the CPU and RAM workload increase, means that I anticipate 5 - 6 hours of battery life utilizing basic cloud based applications.  Streaming movies or playing basic games will decrease the life more.  Non CPU intensive desktop productivity software should increase the battery life.  The power port is proprietary so you will need to carry the brick and cords if you need more battery life during your day.  From an IT prospective, this is a blessing due to the number of infected USB C chargers that have begun popping up in public spaces.Most of the volunteers in the organization are older and greatly appreciate the larger display size.  There is no touch display option.  The maximum resolution is 1920x1080, but the overall quality does not keep up with mid level or elite laptops.  The viewing angle is about 120 degrees from the side and less from the top.  Graphics performance is low.  The colors are not as rich and the contrast is not as dynamic as better displays.  This does include HDMI 2.0.  I do not think it could drive a display with higher resolution very well though.  It is fine for plugging presentations in to a projector or large display.  I do not see much improvement on this display vs the 2017 - 2019 ACER E15 series laptops these are replacing.The webcam is basic.  The speakers are small and face down.  There is a single microphone.  If you speak on calls, a headset is a must.  If you listen on calls, this is adequate provided your space is quiet enough for the small speakers.  The overall sound quality is a compromise between value and quality leaning heavily on value.The keyboard is textured.  It is not backlit.  There is not indication that Caps lock or Number Lock are engaged.  So far, I prefer it to the usual flat chiclet keyboards that haunt modern laptops.  The key response is good.  The number pad keys are smaller than the regular keys and some of the buttons are not in standard 10 key locations.  The keyboard also does not use the standard inverted T for the arrow keys.  This is either a learning curve or an annoyance depending on the user.  Time will tell regarding dust and foreign debris issues and how difficult it is to change a key, switch or the entire keyboard.The touchpad is large enough to cover the display area adequately.  It is sensitive enough to cover tap clicking or actual clicking depending on user preference.  I do miss the button that disables the touchpad to eliminate palm pressing, but that disappeared with optical drives on every computer.The ports are great.  This laptop has  2 USB 3.2 and one USB C on the left side, and one USB 2.0 on the right side.  It also has gigabit ethernet and HDMI 2.0 on the left side and a headphone port on the right side.  The SD card reader has disappeared to no big loss.  Many of my volunteers prefer corded mice and happen to be right handed.  A USB port on the right side is really nice.  The power port is proprietary since this is USB C instead of Thunderbolt 3/4.  That is a nice range of current and future connectivity.  The average user will not need to utilize a dock or USB hub with this laptop.The WI-FI supports both 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz protocols.  It maxes out at WI-FI 5 speeds.  The built in ethernet port is gigabit which maxes out at 125mbps.  Both are adequate for streaming, web browsing, email, and basic Internet use.  Most home networks are gigabit so this slots in very well.  I was able to maintain transfers at 2.3GBe with a USB 3.2 to 2.5GBe adapter.  There is no wireless upgrade option.You can access the main board and components with nothing more than a 00 Phillips screwdriver.  There is a single RAM slot and it utilizes NVMe 3.0.  The base model is a little light on both RAM and storage, but for a workstation, it is adequate.  For a more power user, you can upgrade both, which is nice and becoming rare in most laptops.  The NVMe drive is not heat shielded nor is it installed in a place with good airflow.  I would not be surprised to encounter heat throttling during periods of heavy use.  The overall drive life may be compromised as well.  Time will tell.  There are no additional unused SATA, PCI, or NVMe ports for expansion.  You cannot upgrade the CPU and there is no expansion port to add discrete graphics.  No surprise there.I immediately exited Windows S mode during initial setup.  Any program that won't allow a user to even utilize a different browser, isn't right for me.  This may be nice if you are attempting to keep users away from applications and websites of questionable origin but our desktop software will never be listed in the MS store and our cloud based software is not stable in Edge.The bottom line is that this laptop is designed for non power users and companies looking for a laptop that is more powerful and less controlled than the average Chromebook.  If your user experience is surfing the Internet, streaming videos, checking email, and running software that will never be listed in an App Store, this is a great option.  If you want to play games, or edit video or graphics, this is not the right choice for you.  Based on previous ACER experience, we anticipate 5 years of service out of these which is a great return of investment.",4

The laptop itself is fine but the operating system experience is really the part that makes me regret my purchase.For context my wife owns a slightly earlier model of this laptop and it seemed decent so I purchased the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-53S3 model. I opted to spring for the model with a decent graphics card (Iris XE) and larger solid state drive(storage) because my intent was to use this to play low end/low effort games on the couch while the kiddo and wife watched shows or movies. Even though it suffers from a shortage of RAM, it does seem like it will serve the purpose however I am disappointed with the user experience overall.Straight to the point: Windows 11 is awful. My wife's laptop came with windows 10, I helped her set it up and customize it the way she likes it. The laptop I just purchased came with windows 11 and it is an entirely different story. The initial setup alone was exhausting with multiple attempts by Microsoft to get me to agree to letting them track everything I do, including specific text regarding logging everything I type as well as my browser history and web interactions. They also attempt to sell you Microsoft services right off the bat in the form of free trial periods for 365, their cloud services and more. A few of them even note ""credit card required"" next to the automatically checked box if you wanted to continue. To me this felt pretty crummy. I just bought a 500 dollar laptop and they are already trying to get more money out of me before I even finish the initial setup. Acer adds to the issue by also offering deals, software and registering the product in exchange for services I have absolutely no interest in.It would be alright if it stopped there but unfortunately that is only the beginning of my disdain. I have only had the laptop for about 19 days and yet it seems like every other time I boot up the system something new pops up. The first few times it was programs installing themselves and congratulating me on my newly unrequested/not permitted acquisitions. Acer took it upon themselves to load Norton Antivirus on my system well after I finished the initial setup process. Icons for Amazon web games are created and appear in my start bar/menu randomly. I've deleted the Microsoft edge browser icon off my desktop and start bar and yet it continues to reappear. Its asked to update 3 times in the 19 days that I've owned it. It seems like one of out every 3 times I start the system it seems slow and sluggish to fully load windows only to find out something has been added without my consent. Which is especially anoying seeing that the system already comes with tons of applications pre loaded similar to buying a new smart phone. Tiktok, messanger apps, amazon prime, Disney+ and more, perhaps Im getting old but I would much rather install what I want myself then have to uninstall tons of apps I will never use from the system.As stated before there is not much RAM, even on the higher end model I purchased. Checking the performance page in task manager you can see that even without any other self installed apps running, windows and Acer's apps consume 4 of the 8 GB of system RAM. Uninstalling and shutting down a bunch of truly unessential apps and services I was able to get it down to 3/8 GB. The 256GB SSD is also already partially consumed by windows itself which no amount of uninstalling pre loaded apps seems to resolve.It does have enough resources to play games including some older titles that have 3D graphic requirements. I have not tried to play modern titles or expect it to play more graphic intensive titles but 3D style graphic MMORPGs, Adventure games and the like run pretty well. It does seem to have some issues playing intros and cut scenes sometimes and most annoying is the fact that letting the laptop go to sleep by inactivity or closing the lid causes most games to either crash outright or become slow and consistently stutter to the point where you have to close and reopen the application to resolve the issue.Battery life is about where I would expect it. Playing graphic games seems to drain it pretty quick. 90% to 40% in about 2 hours of running a low end games. It will last a short flight or a long movie but I expect to have to have it plugged in when ever I wanna really sink into playing something. Speakers are good enough as I wouldn't expect anything great out of a compact laptop. Screen looks crisp and bright.I cannot say I will likely return the laptop just based on the fact that almost all other laptops available at this point will will also have Windows 11 installed. Its not really an issue with the hardware as much as it's just the operating system that really rubs me the wrong way. I don't feel like its my personal computer. It feels more like a smart phone. I am having less and less faith the system will stay how I left it. The updates are forced and can only be put off for a max of 3 weeks. Gone are the days of getting a system how you like it and it staying that way. Here to stay is the age of only partial owning your system, being subjected to constant updates and with that the assumption its going to run worse and worse over time, plus always having some new unwanted surprise in store every time it is powered up.",3

Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.Some of the cons:- The power adapter is a very small ""pin"" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.- No Thunderbolt Port- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.",5

There is a process to charge the battery fully so it will take a full charge throughout its life.  You have to drain it until it reaches about 18%.  A popup should warn you when you reach this battery level; instead you have to keep checking.  Not used to babysitting this computer, the battery ended discharging completely.  I thought connecting the adapter would get the computer up and running.  Not so.  I placed a call to Amazon tech support and learned about battery reset located on the bottom of the computer, a tiny pin-hole that you press a toothpick into for four seconds to reset the battery.  Then you need to long-press the power button for ten seconds to boot it up.  Today I had about 76% battery power left and closed the lid briefly and it turned off.  It took another battery reset and long-press to get it going again.  Chrome tells me it didn't shut down properly, click to restore tabs.  Something with Alexa too, doesn't quite work properly.  So it was a software glitch that caused the problem.  I don't expect this to be the last time this happens.Otherwise this is a well-running machine, no other problems and I've had it 3 - 4 weeks.  Keyboard works fine; I think the screen display is satisfactory (but then again I'm not a techie).  The cover is made of aluminum material and is very attractive with the raised ACER logo in silver.  I can tell that in time, depending on wear and tear, the logo could fall off;  I don't think it's that securely attached.  I paid just below $250, a brand new computer with Windows 11 S mode, which you can disable.  Back to the battery; it will take over 1,000 + charges if maintained properly; it's all in the user manual that can be downloaded from the ACER website.  That adds up to about three years of usage.  The main thing I don't like is having to babysit the battery; you have to go as far to the extremes of discharge and recharge to get maximum usage of it over its lifetime.  So I kind of feel tethered to this thing.  For the price it can't be beat though for looks and basic functioning and I got it at a steal on cyber Monday.  This is my first off-brand computer, ACER not having the brand recognition of Toshiba, sadly;  they only market to the business sector now, in case you're wondering why you don't see them anymore.",3

There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern).

I can see the extra HDD in Windows 11, but can't boot from it, to boot into Windows 7.I can't boot from my USB ports when I tried using a memory stick.When I got into the BIOS, there's no option to boot to anything else...only ""Windows Boot Manager"".There are other users of Acer laptop who have had the same issue... I'm still seeking a solution for this, because I would like to boot off of Windows 7(in my extra HDD), and use the SDD storage as extra storage(wiping off Win11 from the storage).But overall....fast computer..bright screen...I would recommend it!****Update*****(1/07/2023)Still have not found a solution for how to Boot from the second HDD I installed, or USB stick. I just stuck with Windows 11 instead of the Windows 7 I have on my other instead drive. In other words, I just gave up.

For rreference though My last laptop I had was used when I recieved it and ""on its last legs"" and started having noticible issues once it turned 11 years old...I enjoy doing video editing and that over a decade old laptop was no longer covering it so I decided to inest in this laptop. With its core I7 processer of 16gb of ram its doing really well amd seems to not struggle at all for what I do and or need. Its a good computer cabale of doing lots of work and the battery life is superb. I ran a couple of stress tests on it and it preformed well. The one downside is that because its windows 11 alot of stuff that was free and or included on windows 10 or lower is not included , most of the software thats available on this laptop is consistent of free trials or trying to get you to make a yearly purchase to use the programs such as the microsoft suite ( which will run 99$ a year or the price of like 9.99 a month). And the free trials are short lived or require you to put in credit card info...so I would suggest anyone who gets this laptop to be ready to either pay for what use to be free or start doing research on free open source software that is comparable to whatever programs you may want to use that are no longer free on the windows platform. Windows 11 isnt really bad its just different. As for the hardware I suggest doing your research before buying this laptop, and make sure you get the correct processer type for what you do, core I3 or below will not cut it in most cases try core i5 or higher and get atleast 16gb of ram aka memory to be on the safe side for anything other then really light light computer use. Also since this is a thinner laptop it has no cd rom and can in some cases overheat a little as it needs some ventalation when in use if doing heavy duty work which is to be expected for its thinness, and my very slight complaint is that while doing heavy duty work it can get to humming a bit too loudly for my taste but nothing that is too terribly concerning. I reccomend this laptop and I love it thus far.",4

The laptop is lightweight and has a sleek look, and the screen is nice and crisp and you can hardly notice the bezels. The aluminum top cover is beautiful, and the chassis feels really nice on all sides. I'm a big fan of the elevated design, improving air flow, and this laptop was 40% cheaper than the last one I saw with the same specs. Which by the way had just shipped, so I got charged for it while this laptop was on sale for $30 less than its current price. :) Except, the one I had just bought did not have the same specs at all. The same CPU, but... I'd been planning to buy an Acer Aspire and upgrade the storage and RAM for many years now. Cyber Monday finally came at a time when I could afford to do soThe first problem, one that didn't occur until two months and got much worse over the next two months, was that the plug for the charger stopped behaving. You know how a cable gets when it goes bad- it gets picky and doesn't work unless its bent or pushed in some way. The contact still entered, but didn't seem to seat on something and was a little bent. I resolved this issueThe next was that, somehow, the heatsink assembly next to the fan got misaligned. The heat pipe had a dent, which may have meant the remaining length was bending or deflecting in some way and now failing to align the heatsink with the fan. I wondered how this happened, but about last week I was walking around with the laptop in one hand (yknow, like, you have a right to do with laptops...) when I felt the bottom chassis contact with the fan under my finger. That's not something that's ever happened to me before! If it's so bendy at the bottom there, that bottom part needs to be made more robust somehowThe i3 model, also, doesn't have a backlit KB. Neither did the cheapest Ryzen model in this generation of Acer Aspire laptops. What the heck, Acer? Why do you hate poor people?Thanks to the upgrades, I can probably sell this thing for a profit, but I'm going to be wary of the Acer Aspire line from now on, if not Acer laptops in general... truthfully, though this thing is a disappointing 2/5 but when upgraded I can be more generous at 3/5, the rating on this thing really needs to be taken down a notch... sorry Acer, but I like your monitors better",1

He was on the phone with me for all of about 7 minutes before he told me to call back if it didn't work because there were other people in the queue.

Bought it to replace a laptop HP that is less than a  year old that was an utter disappointment. It cost twice as much as the Acer and far less nimble or ready for anything of significance.  It is basically just a great paperweight.  The Acer, however, out of the box is lightening fast and incredibly easy to maneuver.  The keyboard has a nice bounce and I'm loving having the numeric keypad - highly unusual for a laptop!Here's what I didn't expect which was incredibly nice to have:1.  That annoying webcam peep-hole...Acer provides a couple of plastic covers so you can keep it covered when not in use and open it when you need to show your beautiful face.  Now, HP never provided anything like that!2.  They even supply screws for the installation of an additional internal hard drive, should you make such a purchase.  Now, how sweet is that?!  I would not have an idea how to do that but I did appreciate the thought.More than anything, the machine has just been solid as a rock and has not flinched at any level.  If there's any regret, it's the fact that Windows 11 is installed in some odd security mode which makes installing the drivers for printers and other devices nearly impossible.  Having to maneuver all of that was more of a headache than anything else and that's a Microsoft issue, having nothing to do with Acer.  Once Windows 11 safe mode is uninstalled, it's smooth sailing.Details matter and Acer won me on the details, quality and sturdiness of this computer.  Will certainly look to buy more Acers in the future.  I am extremely happy with this purchase and incredibly sorry I did not consider this brand in the past.  Won't make that same mistake again.Highly recommend!  In fact, I just might buy another one for work...",1
